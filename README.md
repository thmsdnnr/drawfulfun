#LEARNING NODE.JS

First big "MEEN" stack project using MongoDB for image storage (indexing filenames, image metadata, and userinfo to fetch things from the file system, express JS for serving up and routing, and Embedded Java Script currently for the view (hence MEEN instead of MEAN). Plan to deploy on Heroku when more stable. Right now working on adding additional features and small bug fixes. Learning tons!

##QUICK WINS
[ ] For the filter fill colors, like say lighten, take an average of the information in the overlaid region.
[ ] Modal with pretty window-size dragging / validation / etc.
[ ] Destination-in tends to crash the app.
[ ] Color palettes
[ ] Keyboard toggle for circle radius up/down
[ ] Toggle-able jitter function + jitter "amount/range"
[ ] Make jitter global and be able to control jitter params
[ ] Maybe make jitter only part of automatic mode
[ ] Have a text write function or a text brush
[ ] Better tool display (hoverable div perhaps relative positioned to the right border of the canvas)
[ ] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39029893/why-is-the-mongodb-node-driver-generating-instance-pool-destroyed-errors
[ ] ALL the FILTERS
[ ] Selective filter application to "regions" of the canvas
[ ] Text tool (font face, font size, text input)
[ ] Random size on-off
[ ] Random colors on-off
[ ] Sliders for random size range
[ ] Background-color changer
[ ] Store IMGUR links
[ ] Login session cookie
* [ ] Logout button that actually functions haha
[ ] Better EJS and/or Jade integration
[ ] Can have a Login-meta collection w/ stuff like login count, last logged in time, user metadata (not creepy tho!), etc.
[ ] favorite tools, etc. tool-tips based on previous drawing behavior or brand new things!
[ ] Admin login with a "management console":
 ->view all images with option to delete
 ->view all users with data and option to delete

[ ] Better design: pixel-perfect, em, etc.
[ ] Grab random unsplash.it image based on user size input on landing screen using the API
[ ] Offer filter and collage operations
[ ] Image comparison?
[ ] Better SVG filters
[ ] Randomization seed from sentences etc.
[ ] Latte-art mode
[ ] Mark Rothko mode


###the long game
[ ] App path of usernames with a user page of images and cool stuff like that
[ ] Maybe look at modularizing the FS stuff in addition to the db stuff.
[ ] Make sure that you're using asynchronous everything!
[ ] Maybe look at a different way of doing state storage for the app.

#HANDWAVEY BIG PICTURE
[ ] Selective "region" application of filters, composite blend, etc., masking effects
[ ] Have generative art functions
[ ] Have more collage functions
[ ] More image export modes
[ ] Prettier image storage than base64 PNG!
[ ] Actual BRUSHES that can be user-defined

* handy mongo misc commands
listen(): bind() failed Address already in use for socket: 0.0.0.0:27017
ps wuax | grep mongo
kill PID associatd with Mongo

mongod --dbpath ./mongodata

###User image page:
[ ] Conditiional button if uploaded to IMGUR to manage IMGUR link
  -> back-end: store imgur link in image collection w/images
  -> store imgur deletion code on back-end as well
  -> store "canvas preferences"
  -> mode to "save canvas preferences/set-up to come back, maybe have a list"
  -> canvas/image effects, transformations, define-your-own transform matrix, etc.

###Canvas mods:
##COMPLETED ðŸ’¥
[X] Add listener to the canvas so when mouseleave the "potential" next event disappears
[X] Last saw you here at 6:8! [zero pading minutes, non-24hr time hours
[X] Undo mode:
1. Array of previous canvases
2. Last 5 steps say
3. Push current state on. If length = max, Array.shift() to throw off oldest state, Array.push() to push on the newest
4. To step back in time with undo, for each push of undo button, set current canvas state to Array[Array.length-(1+#undoPresses)] until we get back to zero, then "no more undo steps"
5. For redo to step forward in time, set canvas state to Array[<undoState>+REDO PRESSES] until <undoState>+REDO PRESSES = Array.length-1.
6. CS.undoState = 0 initially, CS.undoArr=[] initially.
[X] Redo mode (reverse above)
[X] Cursor preview for filter application. STEPS:
 0. Make cursor the size of the brush/effect before the effect is clicked to the canvas.
 1. Create a mask the size of the cursor.
 2. Apply currently selected effect to the masked area.
 3. "Print" to canvas but don't save unless clicked.
 -> The challenge here was that stacking two canvases on top of one another made the lower canvas not receive my mouse events due to the way I was querySelector-ing things.
[X] Toggle-able mouse "Velocity" or basically fire-frequency
[X] Maybe make square single-draw at center of square instead of upper-left corner
[X] Canvas Rendering Context 2D Global Composite Blending operations
[X] Break up the mouse-down / mouse-drag code, DRY DRY DRY!
[X] A brush is basically just an X-Y matrix with defined opacities and transformations at each x-y, no?
e.g., brush: MxN array of 0 or 1 for paint pixel or don't paint pixel. M = CS.radius

0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
[X] Mouse velocity-driven line width
[X] Pen mode
[X] Shape mode
[X] Image gallery
[X] Time of login: e.g., "Welcome back! you were last here on . . ."

#NOTES
http://www.nodebeginner.org/#javascript-and-nodejs

"We want to serve web pages, therefore we need an HTTP server
Our server will need to answer differently to requests, depending on which URL the request was asking for, thus we need some kind of router in order to map requests to request handlers
To fulfill the requests that arrived at the server and have been routed using the router, we need actual request handlers
The router probably should also treat any incoming POST data and give it to the request handlers in a convenient form, thus we need request data handling
We not only want to handle requests for URLs, we also want to display content when these URLs are requested, which means we need some kind of view logic the request handlers can use in order to send content to the user's browser
Last but not least, the user will be able to upload images, so we are going to need some kind of upload handling which takes care of the details"

# LEARNINGS

*  mongoConnect(function(m){console.log(m);},{userkname:"avery"});

If you mistype a data parameter MONGO will return EVERYTHING. This could result in really undesirable behavior. So make sure your parameters are typed correctly.

# MONGO shell commands

* show dbs ->list of databases
* use <DB NAME> -> switch to db
* when in a db, `show collections` -> shows collections in the db
* when in a db, db.[COLLECTIONNAME].find() -> shows all items.
* can specify query parameters in the find() e.g., {user:"name"}

* [X] you should also close your connections after you open them so they don't accumulate
